## PowerShell Script:
This script is set to work with Samsung 360 (2017) with Photo Size settings: 5792x2896

Download "Install" and "PhotoStitch" files

### First install of FFmpeg:
To simplify the installation process of **FFmpeg** I created an Installation script.

1. Download the `Install` file.
2. `Right Click` on it and select `Run with PowerShell`.
3. Answer `[Y]Yes` to the installation questions.
4. Restart your PC to complete the installation process.

***The Installation only needs to be performed once***

### Usage:

1. Download the `PhotoStitch` file.
2. Drag and Drop this file `PhotoStitch` into the folder with your Photos.
3. `Right Click` on it and select `Run with PowerShell`.

***When the script will finish to stitch all photos it will automaticly exit, You will get aditional `mergemap` file remained from stitching process, you can delete it.***


## Best Preview app
