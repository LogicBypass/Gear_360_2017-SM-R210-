<# 
C - Width of interpolation band in degrees, must be smaller or equal than FOV "try from 6 to 11 for smoother stitch edge" 
H - Half of the image width = height of input image after cropping
FOV - field of view of the fisheye lenses in degrees, "try to play with it from 190 to 199, Be sure to change all 7 of them!" 

For debuging edges use "bgr24" instad of "gray8"
